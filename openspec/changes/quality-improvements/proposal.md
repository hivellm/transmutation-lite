# Quality Improvements and Production Readiness

## Why

The initial implementation is complete, but the project needs comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and production readiness improvements before npm publication. Current gaps include:

- Limited test coverage (only 16 basic tests)
- No sample files for format-specific testing
- Missing performance benchmarks
- PPTX converter uses basic jszip (experimental quality)
- No streaming support for large files
- No caching layer
- Not published to npm yet

## What Changes

- Expand test suite with real document samples
- Add performance benchmarks and memory profiling
- Improve PPTX converter quality
- Implement streaming support for large files
- Add optional caching layer
- Prepare for npm publication with proper package configuration
- Add GitHub Actions workflows
- Improve error handling and validation
- Add progress events for long conversions

## Impact

- **Affected specs:**
  - document-conversion (enhanced)
  - cli-interface (enhanced)
- **Affected code:**
  - All converter implementations
  - Test suite expansion
  - CLI enhancements
  - Package configuration
- **Breaking changes:** None (additive improvements)
