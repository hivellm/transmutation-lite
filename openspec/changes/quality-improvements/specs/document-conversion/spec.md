# Document Conversion Capability - Quality Improvements

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Streaming Support for Large Files
The system SHALL support streaming conversion for files larger than 100MB to reduce memory usage.

#### Scenario: Stream large PDF file
- **WHEN** a PDF file larger than 100MB is converted with streaming option
- **THEN** the system processes the file in chunks
- **AND** keeps memory usage below 200MB
- **AND** provides progress updates

#### Scenario: Disable streaming for small files
- **WHEN** a file smaller than 100MB is converted
- **THEN** the system uses in-memory conversion by default
- **AND** optionally allows streaming if explicitly requested

### Requirement: Progress Event Reporting
The system SHALL emit progress events during long-running conversions.

#### Scenario: Report conversion progress
- **WHEN** a large file conversion is in progress
- **THEN** the system emits progress events with percentage
- **AND** includes estimated time remaining
- **AND** allows progress callback registration

#### Scenario: CLI progress bar
- **WHEN** converting files via CLI
- **THEN** the system displays a progress bar
- **AND** updates in real-time
- **AND** shows completion percentage

### Requirement: Caching Layer
The system SHALL provide optional caching to avoid redundant conversions.

#### Scenario: Cache conversion result
- **WHEN** caching is enabled and a file is converted
- **THEN** the system stores the result in cache
- **AND** uses file hash as cache key
- **AND** returns cached result for identical files

#### Scenario: Cache invalidation
- **WHEN** a cached file is modified
- **THEN** the system detects file changes
- **AND** invalidates the cache entry
- **AND** re-converts the file

---

### Requirement: Format Validation via Magic Bytes
The system SHALL validate file format using file signature before conversion.

#### Scenario: Detect format mismatch
- **WHEN** a file has .pdf extension but wrong signature
- **THEN** the system detects the mismatch
- **AND** throws validation error with clear message
- **AND** suggests correct format if detectable

#### Scenario: Validate file structure
- **WHEN** a file appears corrupted
- **THEN** the system detects structural issues
- **AND** provides actionable error message
- **AND** avoids attempting conversion

### Requirement: Memory Usage Monitoring
The system SHALL monitor and report memory usage during conversions.

#### Scenario: Warn on high memory usage
- **WHEN** conversion uses more than 500MB of memory
- **THEN** the system logs a warning
- **AND** suggests using streaming mode
- **AND** continues conversion if possible

#### Scenario: Abort on memory limit
- **WHEN** memory usage exceeds configured limit
- **THEN** the system aborts conversion
- **AND** frees allocated resources
- **AND** provides clear error message

### Requirement: PDF to Markdown Conversion
The system SHALL convert PDF files to Markdown format using text extraction with improved formatting preservation.

#### Scenario: Convert PDF file successfully
- **WHEN** a valid PDF file is provided
- **THEN** the system extracts text content
- **AND** returns markdown with document metadata
- **AND** includes page count and file information

#### Scenario: Preserve PDF formatting
- **WHEN** a PDF contains columns or structured layout
- **THEN** the system detects column layout
- **AND** preserves reading order
- **AND** maintains paragraph structure

#### Scenario: Handle embedded fonts
- **WHEN** a PDF uses embedded fonts
- **THEN** the system extracts text correctly
- **AND** handles special characters
- **AND** warns about missing glyphs

#### Scenario: Limit PDF pages
- **WHEN** maxPages option is provided
- **THEN** the system processes only the specified number of pages
- **AND** includes a warning about truncation

- **AND** preserves slide order
- **AND** includes slide titles as headers

#### Scenario: Extract speaker notes
- **WHEN** a PPTX contains speaker notes
- **THEN** the system extracts notes as blockquotes
- **AND** associates notes with corresponding slides
- **AND** marks them clearly in markdown

#### Scenario: Handle slide layouts
