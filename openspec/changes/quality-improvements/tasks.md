**Results:** Package 100% ready for publication, all infrastructure configured

## Phase 8: Integration & Ecosystem ⏭️ SKIPPED

**Rationale**: Transmutation Lite is a standalone library. HiveLLM Classify will consume it as a standard npm dependency - no special integration layer needed.

**Architecture**:
```typescript
// In Classify project:
import { Converter } from '@hivellm/transmutation-lite';

const converter = new Converter({ enableCache: true });
const result = await converter.convertFile('document.pdf');
// Use result.markdown for classification
```

No bidirectional dependencies or integration packages required.

## Phase 9: Advanced Features ⏭️ SKIPPED (Future Consideration)

**Rationale**: Current feature set is complete for the target use case. Advanced features like OCR, image extraction, and additional formats are better suited for the full Transmutation Rust library.

**Future Considerations** (for v2.0+):
- Image extraction from PDF/DOCX/PPTX
- OCR integration for scanned documents
- Additional formats (RTF, ODT, CSV)
- Streaming support for very large files
- Plugin system for custom converters
- REST API / web service

These would be additive features that don't block the current production release.

  - [x] 10.1.4 Buffer size limits (500MB max) ✓
  - [x] 10.1.5 22 validation tests ✓
